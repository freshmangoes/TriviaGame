# TriviaGame

Timer-based trivia game! Also happens to be about broken cars.

The user is given a multiple choice question, with a timer of 25 seconds. If the timer count down completes before the user makes a guess, it is counted as a loss. Upon pressing a correct answer, 'Correct!' will appear in the jumbotron and the next question will be loaded.

Written in vanilla HTML/CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. 

- setInterval() and setTimeout() are used for timer implementation. 
- jQuery is used to dyamically render each question/answer set
